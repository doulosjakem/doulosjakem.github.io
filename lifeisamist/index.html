        Life is a Mist tells the stories of several characters, one of which
        being Sehn, who struggles to grapple with his identity being part of
        both fallen man, and an ancient line of fallen beings. He will in time
        need to learn to use his power over shadows to create noctis fire,
        water, earth, and air magicks. He will need allies, as he's pursued by
        forces much larger than himself that have a keen interest in his ancient
        lineâ€™s power. A natural rival with the more technologically minded
        Jamison, who fancies himself as a skeptic, thinker, tinkerer, and
        innovator, who is puzzled by the strange phenomena that has been
        happening lately.

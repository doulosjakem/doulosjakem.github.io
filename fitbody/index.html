<!-- Jake Miller 4/22/2022 
    Thank you to Elisa Lowenstein for allowing me to modify this assignment
    I'm a christian, and have a conscious against Yoga because unlike simply
    stretching, it is a form of hindu worship. If it were simply stretching
    it would not be yoga, if it is yoga it is not merely physical but a spiritual
    excercise. So Elisa was gracious enough to allow me to create a modified website.
    Welcome to the not-so creatively named "Fit Body Fitness Center"!
